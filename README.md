=====

Salim is an API for development of personal finance software.
Salim is a Python software and uses [Storm ORM](https://storm.canonical.com/) to abstract the database interface, so we can use Postgress, MySQL or SQLite as database systems.
Salim intends to provide a structured way to store the financial information obtained from OFX and CSV files (we also consider to support OFC format).
